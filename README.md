This is my first website created on a pure PHP and MVC structure with thoughtful routing.

Functions that work on the site:
1. User part of the site
- Withdrawal of writings and authors from the database
- Authorization in the admin panel (password in the form of "Hash" is stored in the database)

2. Admin panel
- Output of all information about authors and works
- The function of adding the authors, writings
- Function of editing the authors, writings
- The function of deleting the authors, writings
- Exit the admin panel

Technologies used:
- HTML, CSS
- PHP
- MySQL

Adminpanel 
	- login: admin
	- password: 123123

Db
